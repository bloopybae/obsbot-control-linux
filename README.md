# OBSBOT Control for Linux

A native Qt6 application for controlling OBSBOT cameras on Linux. Provides full camera control with an intuitive GUI while allowing simultaneous use with streaming/conferencing software.

**Primary testing**: OBSBOT Meet 2
**Also works with**: OBSBOT Tiny 4K (partial feature support - see [Compatibility](#compatibility))

## Features

### Camera Control
- **Pan/Tilt/Zoom (PTZ)** - Precise camera positioning with center reset
- **Auto-Framing** - AI-powered face tracking with single/upper body modes
- **Image Settings** - Brightness, contrast, saturation with auto/manual modes
- **Field of View** - Wide (86¬∞), Medium (78¬∞), Narrow (65¬∞)
- **HDR** - High Dynamic Range for better exposure
- **Face AE/Focus** - Face-based auto exposure and auto focus
- **White Balance** - Multiple presets (auto, daylight, fluorescent, etc.)

### Live Preview
- **Camera Preview** - Real-time video preview with automatic aspect ratio detection
- **Usage Detection** - Warns when camera is in use by other applications (Chrome, OBS, Zoom)
- **Resource Management** - Automatically releases camera when not needed
- **Intelligent Layout** - Window expands only when preview successfully opens
- **GPU Filters** - Apply GLSL-driven color filters with adjustable intensity for both preview and virtual camera output

### System Integration
- **System Tray** - Minimize to tray, click to restore
- **Start Minimized** - Optional startup directly to system tray
- **Auto-Reconnect** - Reconnects to camera when window is restored
- **State Preservation** - Remembers preview state across hide/show cycles

### Configuration
- **Persistent Settings** - All camera settings saved to XDG-compliant config file
- **Startup Restore** - Camera returns to saved state on connection
- **Manual Control** - Config file is human-readable and editable
- **Validation** - Helpful error messages for invalid configuration

## Why This Matters

OBSBOT cameras have excellent Linux UVC support, but lack native control software. This application:

1. **Simultaneous Use** - Control camera settings while OBS/Chrome streams video
2. **Resource Friendly** - Releases camera when minimized/hidden
3. **Native Performance** - Qt6 application, not Electron
4. **Standard Compliance** - Uses XDG config directories, system tray

## Compatibility

This application was developed and tested primarily with the **OBSBOT Meet 2**, but has been reported to work with other OBSBOT models with varying feature support.

### OBSBOT Meet 2 ‚úÖ
- **Fully tested** - All features supported
- PTZ controls, Auto-Framing, HDR, Face AE/Focus, all image controls

### OBSBOT Tiny 4K ‚ö†Ô∏è
**What works:**
- ‚úÖ PTZ controls (Pan, Tilt, Zoom)
- ‚úÖ HDR
- ‚úÖ Manual image controls (Brightness, Contrast, Saturation)
- ‚úÖ White Balance

**What doesn't work:**
- ‚ùå Auto-Framing (can be enabled via camera gestures, but not from app)
- ‚ùå Face-based Auto Exposure
- ‚ùå Face-based Auto Focus (works via Cameractrl though)
- ‚ùå Auto image controls

*Tested and reported by: [samdark](https://github.com/aaronsb/obsbot-camera-control/issues/7)*

### Other Models
Other OBSBOT cameras may work with varying degrees of functionality. The SDK supports multiple product types (Tiny, Tiny 2, Tail Air, Me, etc.), but testing is needed.

**Have another model?** Please [open an issue](https://github.com/aaronsb/obsbot-camera-control/issues) to report compatibility!

## Requirements

### System
- Linux (tested on Arch Linux with KDE Plasma)
- OBSBOT camera (USB connection - see [Compatibility](#compatibility))
- System tray support (KDE, GNOME, etc.)

### Build Dependencies
- Qt6 (Core, Widgets, Multimedia)
- CMake 3.16+
- C++17 compiler (GCC/Clang)
- OBSBOT SDK (included in `sdk/` directory)

### Runtime Dependencies
- Qt6 libraries
- V4L2 (Video4Linux2) support
- `lsof` for camera usage detection (optional but recommended)

## Quick Start

### One-Line Install

For the adventurous, a single command that clones the repo to `~/src/obsbot-camera-control` and builds/installs:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronsb/obsbot-camera-control/main/install.sh | bash
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **What this does:**
- Clones repository to `~/src/obsbot-camera-control`
- Checks dependencies (shows what to install if missing)
- Builds and installs the application
- Adds desktop launcher to your app menu

### Standard Install

If you prefer to review the code first (recommended):

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/aaronsb/obsbot-camera-control.git
cd obsbot-camera-control
./build.sh install --confirm
```

The build script automatically:
- ‚úÖ Checks dependencies (shows install commands for your distro)
- ‚úÖ Builds the application
- ‚úÖ Installs to `~/.local/bin`
- ‚úÖ Adds desktop launcher to your app menu
- ‚úÖ Offers to update your PATH if needed

**Common Commands:**
```bash
./build.sh build --confirm    # Build only
./build.sh install --confirm  # Build and install
./build.sh help              # Show all options
./uninstall.sh --confirm     # Remove installation
```

## Usage

### First Run
1. Connect your OBSBOT camera via USB
2. Launch application
3. Camera connects automatically
4. Adjust settings as desired
5. Settings auto-save to `~/.config/obsbot-control/settings.conf`

### Camera Preview
- Click **"Show Camera Preview"** to enable live preview
- If another app is using the camera, you'll see a warning with the process name
- Close the blocking application and try again
- Preview automatically disabled when window is hidden/minimized
- Use the **Filter** controls above the preview to apply GPU shaders (None, Grayscale, Sepia, Invert, Warm, Cool) and tune their intensity. Changes appear instantly in the preview and in the virtual camera stream.

### Virtual Camera
- Packages ship the systemd unit and modprobe configuration needed for a virtual camera, but they are **not** enabled automatically.
- When you want the feature, either enable the service or load the module manually:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable --now obsbot-virtual-camera.service
  # or
  sudo modprobe v4l2loopback video_nr=42 card_label="OBSBOT Virtual Camera" exclusive_caps=1
  ```
- The app shows whether the virtual camera device exists and gives setup guidance directly in the UI.
- Once the module is active, toggle **Virtual Camera ‚Üí Enable virtual camera output** inside the app to feed OBS/Zoom/Meet.

### Model-Specific Extras
- OBSBOT Tiny 2 family cameras expose additional controls (voice command toggles, LED brightness, microphone pickup distance) through the SDK.
- The desktop app keeps these switches hidden so other models don‚Äôt surface unusable options. Advanced users can experiment via the CLI/SDK if needed.

### System Tray
- Click **X** button to minimize to tray (doesn't quit)
- Click tray icon to show/hide window
- Right-click tray icon for menu
- Enable **"Start minimized to tray"** checkbox for startup behavior

### Workflow Example
Perfect for streaming/conferencing:

1. Start app (optionally minimized to tray)
2. Open OBS and select your OBSBOT camera as video source
3. Click tray icon to show control window
4. Adjust zoom, framing, brightness during stream
5. Hide window to tray when not needed
6. Camera remains available to OBS the entire time

## Configuration

Settings are stored in: `~/.config/obsbot-control/settings.conf`

### Configuration Format
```ini
# Camera Settings
face_tracking=enabled
hdr=disabled
fov=wide
face_ae=enabled
face_focus=enabled
zoom=1.0
pan=0.0
tilt=0.0

# Image Controls
brightness_auto=enabled
brightness=128
contrast_auto=enabled
contrast=128
saturation_auto=enabled
saturation=128
white_balance=auto

# Application Settings
start_minimized=disabled
```

### Manual Editing
- Boolean values: `enabled`/`disabled`, `true`/`false`, `yes`/`no`, `1`/`0`
- FOV values: `wide`/`medium`/`narrow` or `0`/`1`/`2`
- Zoom: `1.0` to `2.0`
- Pan/Tilt: `-1.0` to `1.0` (0 is center)
- Brightness/Contrast/Saturation: `0` to `255`

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Control Interface (SDK)** - USB control endpoint for camera settings
  - Can be used simultaneously by multiple applications
  - Always available when camera is connected

- **Video Stream (V4L2)** - `/dev/video*` device for preview
  - Exclusive access (one app at a time)
  - Preview optional - controls work without it

### Camera Detection
- Automatically finds OBSBOT camera in video device list
- Uses `lsof` to detect which process has video device open
- Filters out own process (control and preview can coexist)

### Resource Management
When window is hidden/minimized:
1. Preview state is saved
2. Preview is disabled if enabled
3. Camera SDK handle is released
4. Other applications can now access camera

When window is shown/restored:
1. Reconnects to camera control interface
2. Waits 1 second for stability
3. Attempts to restore preview if it was enabled
4. Shows warning if preview fails (camera in use)

## Troubleshooting

### Camera not detected
- Check USB connection: `lsof /dev/video0` (adjust device number)
- Verify udev permissions: User should be in `video` group
- Check kernel messages: `dmesg | grep -i video`

### Preview shows wrong camera
- Application auto-detects OBSBOT by name
- If multiple cameras, OBSBOT is selected by description match
- Fallback uses Qt6 Multimedia default camera

### Can't enable preview
- Orange warning shows which process is using camera
- Close blocking application (Chrome, OBS, Zoom, etc.)
- Click "Show Camera Preview" again
- Note: Controls work without preview!

### Settings not saving
- Check config directory exists: `~/.config/obsbot-control/`
- Verify write permissions
- Look for validation errors in config dialog

### System tray icon not showing
- Verify system tray support (KDE, GNOME extension, etc.)
- Check Qt6 platform plugin: `export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct`
- Some minimal window managers lack system tray

## Command Line Interface

A CLI tool is also included for automation/scripting:

```bash
./obsbot-cli
```

See CLI help for available commands.
